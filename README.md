## Basic Try-Catch-Finally

The response in this case is: ArgumentNullExceptionFinally:

- Result += "Okay"; is not executed
- Catch ArgumentNullException, but not Exception
- result += "Finally"; is always executed UNLESS a return statement breaks the flow

```cs
var result = string.Empty;
try
{
    //  Block of code to try
    throw new ArgumentNullException("test");
    result += "Okay";
}
catch (ArgumentNullException e)
{
    //  Block of code to handle exception
    result += "ArgumentNullException";
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    //  Block of code to handle exception
    result += "Catch";
}
finally
{
    // The finally statement is always executed UNLESS a return statement breaks the flow
    result += "Finally";
}

return Ok(result);
```

## throw; vs throw ex;

The **throw;** statement is used to rethrow the current exception while preserving the original stack trace. This is important because the stack trace provides valuable information about where the exception originally occurred, making it easier to debug and diagnose issues

Scenario:

Consider a situation where a method deep in the call stack throws an exception, and you catch it in a higher-level method to perform some logging or cleanup

```cs
try
{
  // some code
}
catch
{
  throw;
}
```

On the other hand, **throw ex;** resets the stack trace to the point where the throw ex statement is executed, losing the original context. This means that the original stack trace information is lost, which can obscure the source of the error and make debugging more difficult.

```cs
try
{
  // some code
}
catch
{
  throw ex;
}
```

### Best Practices

- Use **throw;** instead of "throw ex;" in most situations to rethrow the current exception while preserving the original stack trace

## Custom Exception Types

- .NET provides a hierarchy of exception classes ultimately derived from the Exception base class. For example, ArgumentException. However, if none of the predefined exceptions meet your needs, you can create your own exception class by deriving from the Exception class.
- An inner exception describes the error that caused the current exception

### Best Practices

- End exception class names with Exception and derive it from the Exception class
- Include three constructors. the parameterless constructor, a constructor that takes a string message, and a constructor that takes a string message and an inner exception.
- Provide additional properties only when there's a programmatic scenario where the additional information is useful. For example, the FileNotFoundException provides the FileName property.

## Custom middleware to catch unhandled exceptions

https://localhost:7052/api/Tasks/tasks/weqw

(500 for unhandled server errors, 400 for bad request, 401/403 for unauthorized/forbidden, 404 for not found). Using ProblemDetails for consistent error responses. https://www.treinaweb.com.br/blog/tratando-erros-em-uma-api-asp-net-core-com-middleware

### Best Practices

- Handle Exceptions globally via Custom middleware to avoid duplication of try..catch blocks in all controller actions.
- Map Exceptions to the appropriate HTTP status codes
- Return meaningful and secure error messages to clients

## Handling exceptions with logs

Log issue. Serilog. Logging in middleware and filters

## When to use Exception

- Exception like the name say is a exception. Donâ€™t use as a feature or a condition in the flow

Not found in database. Null instead of exception and Handle issue in upper logic.

Exception Handling in External Dependencies. HTTP clients, databases, file I/O, etc. Wrapping external service errors in custom exceptions

## Retry Logic and Transient Fault Handling

Retry Logic and Transient Fault Handling. Using Polly for retries, fallbacks, and circuit breakers. Avoiding overuse in non-transient exceptions
